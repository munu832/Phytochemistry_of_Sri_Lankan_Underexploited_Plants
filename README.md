# Phytochemistry of Sri Lankan Underexploited Plants

This project showcases the research conducted for a PhD thesis on the production of mosquito repellents using lesser-known, under-utilized volatile oil producing plant species in Sri Lanka. It includes an interactive visualization of chemical constituents found in various plant species.

## Thesis Information

- **Title**: PRODUCTION OF MOSQUITO REPELLENTS USING LESSER-KNOWN, UNDER-UTILIZED VOLATILE OIL PRODUCING PLANT SPECIES
- **Author**: Kavindu Munugoda
- **Degree**: Doctor of Philosophy
- **University**: University of Sri Jayewardenepura
- **Submission Date**: 28.06.2023

## Project Overview

This GitHub Pages site presents an interactive visualization of the chemical constituents found in various plant species studied during the research. The visualization includes:

1. An interactive scatter plot showing chemical constituents across different plant species.
2. A data table with detailed information about each data point.
3. An interactive stack plots showcasing bioactive compounds across different plant species.
4. A gallery showcasing the 29 plant species studied in this research.

## Technologies Used

- Python for data processing and visualization generation
- Bokeh and Ploty for creating interactive plots
- SQLite for data storage
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript for web presentation

## Features

- Interactive scatter plot for comparing chemical constituents across plant species
- Detailed data table with information about each data point
- Gallery of 29 plant species studied in the research

## Page Structure

- `index.html`: Main HTML file for the web interface
- `styles.css`: CSS file for styling the web interface
- `script.js`: JavaScript file for additional interactivity
- `plant_data_visualization.html`: HTML file for main interactive plot of total chemical constituents
- `Stack Plots/`: Directory containing interactive stack plots of the bioactive compounds in studied plant species
