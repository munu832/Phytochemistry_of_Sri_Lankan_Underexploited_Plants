# Mosquito Repellents from Lesser-Known Plant Species

This project showcases the research conducted for my PhD thesis on the production of mosquito repellents using lesser-known, under-utilized volatile oil producing plant species.

## Thesis Information

- **Title**: PRODUCTION OF MOSQUITO REPELLENTS USING LESSER-KNOWN, UNDER-UTILIZED VOLATILE OIL PRODUCING PLANT SPECIES
- **Author**: Kavindu Dinush Munugoda
- **Degree**: Doctor of Philosophy
- **University**: University of Sri Jayewardenepura

## Project Overview

This GitHub Pages site presents an interactive visualization of the chemical constituents found in various plant species studied during the research. The visualization includes:

1. An interactive scatter plot showing chemical constituents across different plant species.
2. A data table with detailed information about each data point.
3. A gallery showcasing the 29 plant species studied in this research.

## Technologies Used

- Python for data processing and visualization generation
- Bokeh for creating interactive plots
- SQLite for data storage
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript for web presentation

## How to Use

Visit the [GitHub Pages site](https://yourusername.github.io/your-repo-name) to explore the interactive visualization and plant gallery.

- Use the scatter plot to compare chemical constituents across different plant species.
- Interact with the data table to view detailed information about each data point.
- Browse the plant gallery to see images of the 29 plant species studied in this research.

## Local Development

To run this project locally:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required Python packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the Python script to generate the visualization: `python bokah_app1.py`
4. Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the site
